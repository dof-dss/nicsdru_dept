# Migrations

For services like the UUID Lookup Manager to function correctly migration files should be named using the content type
machine name
e.g.
- D7 content type machine name: application
- D9 migration filename: migrate_plus.migration.node_application

Do not add an 's' (e.g. applications) to the end of the filename.
